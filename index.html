  <p class="groove">For years this abandoned hospital has been standing here, burden with a dark and terrible history. This hospital, opened back in 1883, started off as a school until the early 1910s until it became bankrupt. For the next set of hundrets of years it became a building full of whispers from past patients; but none more present than one by the name of Cliff. A spirit with no story.</p>
